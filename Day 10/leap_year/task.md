# Leap Year

ðŸ’ª This is a difficult challenge! ðŸ’ª

Write a program that returns `True` or `False` for whether a given year is a leap year.

A normal year has 365 days, leap years have 366, with an extra day in February. The reason why we have leap years is really fascinating â€” this video does it more justice.

## How to determine a leap year

This is how you work out whether a particular year is a leap year:

- Every year that is divisible by 4 with no remainder
- **Except** every year that is evenly divisible by 100 with no remainder
- **Unless** the year is also divisible by 400 with no remainder

If English is not your first language, or if the above logic is confusing, try using a flow chart.

## Examples

### Example 1: Year 2000
```

2000 Ã· 4 = 500 â†’ Leap
2000 Ã· 100 = 20 â†’ Not Leap
2000 Ã· 400 = 5 â†’ Leap!

```
So the year 2000 **is a leap year**.

### Example 2: Year 2100
```

2100 Ã· 4 = 525 â†’ Leap
2100 Ã· 100 = 21 â†’ Not Leap
2100 Ã· 400 = 5.25 â†’ Not Leap

```
So the year 2100 **is not a leap year**.

## Warning

Your return should be a boolean and match the Example Output format exactly, including spelling and punctuation.
